# codeIdeas
A list of programming/coding ideas/projects

The thought behind this repo is to gather ideas for software development projects small as big.
Because sometimes you have that thought in your head that makes perfect sense and is going to revulationaize the world, but when you make it out of the shower you lost your thought and it's gone forever.

The stucture of the repo is that every idea has its own file which has a name of what the idea is in one to three words (approximatly).
